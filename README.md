# Hiking-web
 A hiking web which allows the user to know about the voyages of different hikers and let them post theirs.
 Hi there!
 I am inspired to make this web after recently conquering a very steep[and quite dangerous, didn't tell our parents that ;) mountain with my friends Musaib and Mufaiz(AHEM!!, special thanks to both of em.)

 Enough of the story thing, nowlets see what this web can do,
 First of all you are able to see the people who have gone on their adventures, like you are used to see on social media platforms.
 Then you can also post your own adventures(Ofcourse!)
 After that you can contanct anyone of theperson you like and wanna go on a voyage with, they will get your "Hike Request" and either accept it or reject it.
 If they accept  it,you two can have an chat, decide where you want to meet and then can venture out together
 # Note: The features like able to post and chat will not be availaible for quite a time , for now i will add fake profiles and my own adventures until i learn all the database stuff.
 Sayonara :)(;
